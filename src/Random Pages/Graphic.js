    <h1>Graphic Designing</h1>
    <p>Graphic design is the art or profession of visual communication that combines images, words, and ideas to convey information to an audience, especially 
      to produce a specific effect. In other words, graphic design is communication design; It's a way of conveying ideas through visuals and design.</p>
    <p> Graphic design is actually quite complicated, and I didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did. To my dismay, I was going to spend a whole semester
       mulling over color psychology rather than learning how to master the art of graphic design.</p>
    <p>Many companies hire graphic design agencies to handle their designs for them. So if you're working as an agency graphic designer, chances are you'll
       be receiving a creative brief from companies to work on projects for many different brands. </p>
